    <h2>Sources of Greenhouse Gas Emissions</h2>
    <p>The primary sources of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States and even to the rest of the world are (archive.epa.gov):</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Electricity production:</strong> Electricity production is considered as the second largest contributor of greenhouse gas emissions. Approximately, 62% of our electricity is derived from burning fossil fuels, usually coal and natural gas.</li>
        <li><strong>Transportation:</strong> Burning fossil fuels for cars, trucks, ships, trains, and airplanes serve as the source of greenhouse gases.</li>
        <li><strong>Industry:</strong> Greenhouse gas emissions from industry originate from burning fossil fuels for energy as well as greenhouse gas emissions from certain chemical reactions required to produce goods from raw materials.</li>
        <li><strong>Commercial and residential:</strong> These arise mainly from fossil fuels burned for heat as well as the use of certain products that contain greenhouse gases, and the process of handling of waste that can release unnecessary gases.</li>
        <li><strong>Agriculture:</strong> The source of greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture is livestock such as cows, agricultural soils, and rice production.</li>
        <li><strong>Land use and forestry:</strong> In general, plants and soil can act as an overall "sink" while absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere. Unfortunately, they can serve as source of greenhouse gas emissions when they are being burned or cut down which ends up adding CO2 emissions to the atmosphere.</li>
