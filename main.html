        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Climate change has immensely affected our natural environment and our society in the past. It will continue to do so if we permit. Globally, considerable efforts are made to alleviate the negative effects of climate change and one of which is reduction in carbon emissions. Each one of us plays a major role in this cause. We can take part and contribute significantly to protect our environment, our world against the devastating consequences of this global phenomenon.</p>

    <div class="section" id="abstraction">
        <h2>Abstraction</h2>
        <p>Climate change refers to a long-term shift in global or regional climate patterns. Often climate change refers specifically to the rise in global temperatures from the mid-20th century to present (nationalgeographic.org 2019).</p>
        <p>The cause of current climate change can be accounted largely to human activity. Human activities that contributed to climate change include burning fossil fuels, like natural gas, oil, and coal. Burning these materials releases greenhouse gases into Earth's atmosphere. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere trap heat from the sun's rays causing rise in the earth's average temperature.</p>
        <p>Greenhouse gases include water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases (archive.epa.gov). We call the event of rapid rise in the planet as global warming. The warming of the planet impacts both local and regional climates negatively. Throughout Earth's history, climate has continually changed. Sadly, human induced climate change is occurring at an unprecedented rapid rate (nationalgeographic.org 2019).</p>
        <p>Different types of greenhouse gases have different impacts on the climate, depending on such factors as how much of the gas is produced, how long it stays in the atmosphere, and how much heat it traps. "Carbon dioxide equivalent" (or CO2e) is a unit of measurement that allows the effects of different greenhouse gases to be compared using CO2 as a standard unit for reference (archive.epa.gov).</p>

        <h2>Timeline of Climate Change</h2>
        <h3>Significant events in history related to the emergence of Climate Change</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>1896 - Svante Arrhenius developed the first climate model of the influence of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2).</li>
            <li>1930s - Milutin Milankovitch published "Mathematical Climatology and the Astronomical Theory of Climatic changes that explained the Earth's Ice ages.</li>
            <li>1980 - Curve developed by American Scientist Charles David Keeling began to track atmospheric CO2 concentrations. CO2 concentration in 1960 was approximately 315 ppm parts per million (ppm).</li>
            <li>1990 - First Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report showed pattern of past warming while signaling that future warming is likely.</li>
            <li>1992 - United Nations Conference in Rio de Janeiro established the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.</li>
            <li>1997 - Kyoto Protocol was developed with the purpose to limit greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from industrialized countries.</li>
            <li>2005 - Kyoto Protocol took effect. All major industrialized countries signed except the U.S.</li>
            <li>2007 - Fourth IPCC report declared that effects of global warming are manifesting.</li>

        <h2>Sources of Greenhouse Gas Emissions</h2>
        <p>The primary sources of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States and even to the rest of the world are (archive.epa.gov):</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Electricity production:</strong> Electricity production is considered as the second largest contributor of greenhouse gas emissions. Approximately, 62% of our electricity is derived from burning fossil fuels, usually coal and natural gas.</li>
            <li><strong>Transportation:</strong> Burning fossil fuels for cars, trucks, ships, trains, and airplanes serve as the source of greenhouse gases.</li>
            <li><strong>Industry:</strong> Greenhouse gas emissions from industry originate from burning fossil fuels for energy as well as greenhouse gas emissions from certain chemical reactions required to produce goods from raw materials.</li>
            <li><strong>Commercial and residential:</strong> These arise mainly from fossil fuels burned for heat as well as the use of certain products that contain greenhouse gases, and the process of handling of waste that can release unnecessary gases.</li>
            <li><strong>Agriculture:</strong> The source of greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture is livestock such as cows, agricultural soils, and rice production.</li>
            <li><strong>Land use and forestry:</strong> In general, plants and soil can act as an overall "sink" while absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere. Unfortunately, they can serve as source of greenhouse gas emissions when they are being burned or cut down which ends up adding CO2 emissions to the atmosphere.</li>

        <h2>Climate Change Impact in the Philippines</h2>
        <p>Climate change has significantly influenced various areas in the country including water resources, forestry, agriculture, coastal resources, and health. This global phenomenon will continue to do so if we allow our habits and not so environmentally friendly practices to progress and contribute to the acceleration of global warming (bagong.pagasa.dost.gov.ph 2021).</p>
        
        <h3>Water resources</h3>
        <p>Quality and quantity problems are experienced in areas where rainfall reduction is projected. These will cascade into more adverse effects that definitely impact agricultural land, forestry, health, settlement, and livelihood. Substantial reduction in rainfall affects water supply and limits agricultural production. Energy production is also directly affected. On the contrary, floods, mudslides, and soil erosion may occur in areas where rainfall could be intense during wet periods. Extreme floods can severely affect infrastructures, bridges, roads, classrooms, evacuation centers, and hospitals.</p>
        
        <h3>Forestry</h3>
        <p>Forests may be adversely affected as the global temperature continues to increase. Indigenous communities in forest areas need to be rescued. Climate-resilient alternative livelihoods should be provided for them.</p>
        
        <h3>Agriculture</h3>
        <p>Decrease in crop yield is usually observed whenever temperatures exceed threshold values. In rice, they often suffer from spikelet sterility. Proper management strategies need to be employed to prevent continued reduction in crop yield amidst changing weather patterns. Increase in occurrence and strength of tropical cyclones will also continue to exert unmatched pressure on agricultural production. Unpredictable weather conditions can cause disease incidence or outbreaks affecting both plants and animals. It is necessary that research works will be done to address this concern and identify the relationship between weather events and occurrence of damaging diseases that affect plants and animals. Decreased yields and inadequate job opportunities in the agricultural sector could lead to higher poverty levels and social unrest. Food security will largely be affected due to decreased yield in agriculture. Insufficient food supply could further lead to more malnutrition and other concerns in the society.</p>
        
        <h3>Coastal resources</h3>
        <p>The coastal regions in the country are greatly affected by the joined influence of continuous rising of temperature, changing rainfall level, rising sea level, and increasing incidence of tropical cyclones. These ultimately expose coastal regions to unprecedented threats and damage. The livelihood of residents of coastal areas are also immensely affected because of such natural calamities.</p>
        
        <h3>Health</h3>
        <p>The further increase in global temperature and emergence of devastating natural calamities due to climate change expose the people to water-based and vector-borne diseases. Moreover, people are also prone to pulmonary illnesses and cardiovascular diseases. Malnutrition is expected to become severe in areas with frequent occurrences of extreme events that disturb adequate food supply and support for health services.</p>

        <h2>Measures to Mitigate Negative Impact of Climate Change in the Philippines</h2>
        <p>Currently, there is a good number of promising climate change adaptation programs and projects that are being implemented in the Philippines. Those programs include (bagong.pagasa.dost.gov.ph 2021):</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Millennium Development Goals Fund 1656:</strong> Aims to strengthen the Philippines institutional capacity to adapt to climate change and is funded by the Government of Spain.</li>
            <li><strong>Philippine Climate Change Adaptation Project:</strong> Its primary goal is to develop the resiliency of farms and natural resource management to the effects of climate change funded by the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) through the World Bank.</li>
            <li><strong>Adaptation to Climate Change and Conservation of Biodiversity Project:</strong> Sponsored by GTZ Germany.</li>
            <li><strong>National Framework Strategy on Climate Change:</strong> Envisioned to develop the adaptation capacity of communities funded by the GTZ Germany.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With these set of programs and everyone's engagement, we can all combat the destructive impact of climate change. Nothing is too hard for a resilient and adaptable country.</p>
