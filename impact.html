        <h2>Climate Change Impact in the Philippines</h2>
        <p>Climate change has significantly influenced various areas in the country including water resources, forestry, agriculture, coastal resources, and health. This global phenomenon will continue to do so if we allow our habits and not so environmentally friendly practices to progress and contribute to the acceleration of global warming (bagong.pagasa.dost.gov.ph 2021).</p>
        
        <h3>Water resources</h3>
        <p>Quality and quantity problems are experienced in areas where rainfall reduction is projected. These will cascade into more adverse effects that definitely impact agricultural land, forestry, health, settlement, and livelihood. Substantial reduction in rainfall affects water supply and limits agricultural production. Energy production is also directly affected. On the contrary, floods, mudslides, and soil erosion may occur in areas where rainfall could be intense during wet periods. Extreme floods can severely affect infrastructures, bridges, roads, classrooms, evacuation centers, and hospitals.</p>
        
        <h3>Forestry</h3>
        <p>Forests may be adversely affected as the global temperature continues to increase. Indigenous communities in forest areas need to be rescued. Climate-resilient alternative livelihoods should be provided for them.</p>
        
        <h3>Agriculture</h3>
        <p>Decrease in crop yield is usually observed whenever temperatures exceed threshold values. In rice, they often suffer from spikelet sterility. Proper management strategies need to be employed to prevent continued reduction in crop yield amidst changing weather patterns. Increase in occurrence and strength of tropical cyclones will also continue to exert unmatched pressure on agricultural production. Unpredictable weather conditions can cause disease incidence or outbreaks affecting both plants and animals. It is necessary that research works will be done to address this concern and identify the relationship between weather events and occurrence of damaging diseases that affect plants and animals. Decreased yields and inadequate job opportunities in the agricultural sector could lead to higher poverty levels and social unrest. Food security will largely be affected due to decreased yield in agriculture. Insufficient food supply could further lead to more malnutrition and other concerns in the society.</p>
        
        <h3>Coastal resources</h3>
        <p>The coastal regions in the country are greatly affected by the joined influence of continuous rising of temperature, changing rainfall level, rising sea level, and increasing incidence of tropical cyclones. These ultimately expose coastal regions to unprecedented threats and damage. The livelihood of residents of coastal areas are also immensely affected because of such natural calamities.</p>
        
        <h3>Health</h3>
        <p>The further increase in global temperature and emergence of devastating natural calamities due to climate change expose the people to water-based and vector-borne diseases. Moreover, people are also prone to pulmonary illnesses and cardiovascular diseases. Malnutrition is expected to become severe in areas with frequent occurrences of extreme events that disturb adequate food supply and support for health services.</p>
